        ### Project Introduction
        This website, as the final phase of the capstone project, will contain all deliverables of the project and serve as a publicly accessible site for displaying maps.
        
        In this web application, based on the Streamlit framework, the team developed an interactive dashboard to visualize CDW flows in a variety of graphical views. This tool is useful in policy development for CDW recycling and reuse, providing insight into annual flow trends by material type, transaction, and destination, potentially facilitating a more sustainable approach to CDW management.
