    ### Project Introduction
    This website, as the final phase of the capstone project, will contain all deliverables of the project and serve as a publicly accessible site for displaying maps.
    
    In this web application, based on the Streamlit framework, the team developed an interactive dashboard to visualize CDW flows in a variety of graphical views. This tool is useful in policy development for CDW recycling and reuse, providing insight into annual flow trends by material type, transaction, and destination, potentially facilitating a more sustainable approach to CDW management.
    
    This project is part of a long-term collaboration between New York University (NYU) and the New York City Department of Design and Construction (DDC). This collaboration is embodied in the Town+Gown platform, a city-wide applied research platform designed to connect practitioners, including New York City organizations, with academics. Through this platform, students in NYU's Master of Science in Technology Management and Innovation program are able to engage in real-world research on urban problems and provide innovative solutions.
